These shapes are "rock", "paper", and "scissors".

### How I Made It ?
When any one of buttons rock, paper and scissors when clicked, it makes respective image visible & these three buttons are disabled.
For computer turn, I have used Math.random() function to generate a number between 1 to 3, and for that number an image is displayed. 
Depending on user & computer choices respective result is displayed.

Reset button makes scores zero and performs the function of play again.
